**Squire** is your personal pet armory attendant - a Lua script that takes the ***tedious targeting***, ***fumbling with bags*** and ***spell-gem juggling*** out of arming pets and replaces it with **ONE CLICK**.

**"I WANT TO ARM AN ENTIRE RAID'S WORTH OF PETS AND I DON'T WANT CARPAL TUNNEL"** <sup>(we got you)</sup>

**You get pet toys!. You get pet toys!. <ins>Everybody</ins> gets pet toys!*****

## Painless Pet-Arming with Presets

- Squire ships with **preconfigured class presets** so you can start arming pets immediately - no setup required.*
- Presets check what you have and only show those sources.
- Sources are ordered by priority, and Squire will pick the **best one available** in each category.
- Categories are organized logically: Weapons, Armor, Heirlooms, Masks - each as its own group.

<sup>* Presets currently available for Live/Test and EQ Might... with more to come (someone help me do laz plzkthx).</sup>

## Custom Sets for Control Freaks

Not using a preset class? Want a specific loadout? Squire's set editor lets you build exactly what you want.

- Create custom sets with any combination of **spells, items, or AAs** as sources.
- Four delivery methods: **Direct to Pet**, **Summon to Cursor**, **Summon Bag**, and **Direct Trade** - these should cover nearly any way to arm a pet, including custom emu features.
- Bag methods support folded packs if needed - summon the folded pack, place it, click it, unpack it, hand it all over.
- Toggle sources on or off temporarily, or reorder them as needed. Copy sets to edit and customize.

## Flexible and Full-Featured 

- **Navigation**: Optionally auto-navigate to out-of-range pets (toggle in settings).
- **Inventory Safety**: Frees a top-level inventory slot for bag operations, cleans up after itself, and only deletes items you tell it to.*
- **Tell Access Control**: Allow list, deny list, or open access for tell-triggered arming (Anyone, Group, Raid, Fellowship). You choose the keyword to use.
- **Stop Anytime**: `/squire stop` halts the current operation immediately - mid-cast, mid-delivery, whenever.
- **UI/CLI Integration**: Use the UI for convenience, but we have a full-featured command list that will get the job done.

<sup>* Squire will clean up temp items left in temp bags you tell it to clean up.</sup>
